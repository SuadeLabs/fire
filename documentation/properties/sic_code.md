The United Kingdom [**Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activities**][siccode2007] (SIC) is used to classify business establishments and other standard units by the type of economic activity in which they are engaged. The new version of these codes (SIC 2007) was adopted by the UK as from 1st January 2008.

The classification provides a framework for the collection, tabulation, presentation and analysis of data, and its use promotes uniformity.

In addition, it can be used for administrative purposes and by non-government bodies as a convenient way of classifying industrial activities into a common structure.

The **Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)** is a system used to classify business establishments and other standard units by the type of economic activity in which they are engaged. The appropriate SIC reference depends on jurisdiction:

- **United Kingdom:** For UK-domiciled entities, the applicable reference is the [UK SIC classification][siccode2007] published by the Office for National Statistics. The current version of these codes (SIC 2007) has been in effect since 1 January 2008.

- **United States:** For US-domiciled entities, the applicable reference is the [SIC code list][sec_sic] maintained by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The classification provides a consistent framework for the collection, tabulation, presentation and analysis of economic activity.

The unique identifier of the Facility Risk Rating (FRR).

The Facility Risk Rating (FRR) is a key risk assessment tool used to evaluate the credit risk of a specific facility or loan. It considers factors such as collateral, seniority, repayment structure, and facility-specific risk mitigants to determine the likelihood of default and potential loss in the event of default.

The FRR provides an internal measure of risk at the facility level and is typically used in risk management, capital allocation, and IRB regulatory reporting.

It evaluates the inherent risk based on factors like market conditions, counterparty risk, the structure of the facility, and the collateral or guarantees involved.

The FRR helps in determining the potential for financial loss related to the facility and supports risk management and decision-making processes.

The **reversion_rate** property describes the interest rate to which a loan or security will default after an initial incentive / fixed rate period.

The **reversion_rate** should be recorded as a percentage in decimal format. ie. 3.5% should be represented as 3.5 and not 0.035. There is no restriction to the precision of the number (number of decimal places).

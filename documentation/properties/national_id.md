# national_id

The **national identifier** is a commonly used identification code which enables the unambiguous identification of a counterparty or of the legal entity of which the counterparty forms part within its country of residency

For each counterparty, a national identifier from the “list of national identifiers” for the relevant country (the list of national identifiers can be found on the ECB’s website) is reported, together with the indication of the respective [national identifier type](https://github.com/SuadeLabs/fire/blob/master/documentation/properties/national_id_type.md)

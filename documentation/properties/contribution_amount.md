---

The **contribution_amount** reflects the amount that the adjustment contributes to to the reportable value (in a report/cell). This amount is a monetary amount in minor currency of the corresponding currency_code for the adjustment. Implementation of contributions may differ, but are typically  additive so that multiple contributions can be aggregated.

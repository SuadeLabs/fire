The Borrower Internal Risk Rating has traditionally been the main risk assessment tool used to evaluate the financial stability and creditworthiness of a borrower. It assesses the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan or financial product by considering factors like credit history, financial health, repayment capacity, and broader economic conditions.

The BIRR rating provides an internal measure of risk and is typically used for assessing borrowers in lending or investment decisions.

# ref_income_amount

---

The reference income used for a customer for a loan. Monetary type is represented as an integer number of cents/pence.

The [FCA][fca] defines customer(s) income as the Total Gross Income, which is described as:

> This is the total of the gross annual incomes (before tax or other deductions) of each of the individual borrowers whose incomes were taken into account when the lender made the lending assessment/ decision. For these purposes, each borrower’s gross income is the sum of that person’s main income and any other reckonable income (e.g., overtime and/or income from other sources, to the extent that the lender takes such additional income into account in whole or in part).

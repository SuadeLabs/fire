# ghg_emissions_s3

Scope 3 GHG Emissions (see also: total `ghg_emissions`).

Scope 3 emissions are those emissions in the companies value/supply chain that are not direct emissions or related to indirect emissions from the purchase of energy resources (electricity, heat, gas, fuel) used in the company's operations.

As defined in Annex III of the [EU Benchmark regulations][eu-benchmark]:

> (i) Scope 1 carbon emissions, namely emissions generated from sources that are controlled by the company that issues the underlying assets;
>
> (ii) Scope 2 carbon emissions, namely emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, or other sources of energy generated upstream from the company that issues the underlying assets;
>
> (iii) Scope 3 carbon emissions, namely all indirect emissions that are not covered by points (i) and (ii) that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including both upstream and downstream emissions, in particular for sectors with a high impact on climate change and its mitigation;

# seniority

Seniority describes the seniority of the issuance in the cap table.
A *senior* security ranks highest in a companies liquidation schedule and hence considered the safest form of debt. *subordinated* debt ranks below senior debt, and is therefore considered less safe and first loss specifically refers to the least safe debt, just before equity holders.

A *secured* security is one whose cash flows or credit worthiness is backed by another asset.

# el_irb

---

The **el_irb** is the property of a loan that represents the expected loss, which is the best estimate of the amount to be lost on an exposure from the potential default of a counterparty. Used in the internal ratings based (IRB) approach.

> **EL = PD x LGD**

where EL is the expected loss, PD is the probability of default, and LGD is the loss given default. 

The **el_irb** should be recorded as a percentage between 0 and 1.

# owner_id

---

The **owner_id** identifies the provider of the collateral, including cases where the collateral is provided by a third party.

This attribute is required because the collateral owner may differ from the obligor or instrument holder. The most common scenario is a parent entity pledging collateral on behalf of its branch.

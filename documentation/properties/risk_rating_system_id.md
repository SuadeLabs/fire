# risk_rating_system_id

---

The unique identifier of the Risk Rating System (RRS) used to evaluate a borrower.

This attribute links the Internal Risk Rating to its corresponding RRS, providing context for how the risk assessment is structured. It is essential for ensuring consistency and traceability in risk evaluations across different borrowers and lending scenarios.

Risk rating systems must be approved by the regulator in Canada. See [here][osfi-rrs-approval].

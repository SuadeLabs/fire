Indicates the type of placement for issuances. For example, private placements, other non-publicly offered securites, publicly offered securities or direct purchase municipal securities.

### private_placement

Securities that are sold directly to a small number of institutional or accredited investors, rather than through a public offering. These are typically exempt from registration requirements with regulatory authorities.

### non_public

Securities that are not publicly traded and are offered to a limited number of investors, but may not meet the specific criteria for private placements.

### public_offering

Securities that are offered to the general public through a registered offering process, typically involving an underwriter and compliance with full disclosure requirements.

### direct_purch_municipal

Municipal securities that are purchased directly from the issuer without the involvement of an underwriter or public offering process.

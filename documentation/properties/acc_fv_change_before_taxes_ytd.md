# acc_fv_change_before_taxes_ytd

---

This is the accumulated change in fair value before taxes (YTD) from the start of the financial year.

This can be calculated by adding all gains and losses from remeasurements of financial instruments accumulated from the start of the financial year up to the reference date. These gains and losses are included as they are reported in the statement of profit or loss, and therefore the amount reported will be before taxes.

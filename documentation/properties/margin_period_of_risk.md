# margin_period_of_risk

The **margin_period_of_risk** attribute allows institutions to provide their estimate of the margin period of risk (MPOR), expressed in business days, for the transactions covered by the agreement (CSA) [CRE 52.50]. As the MPOR is subject to a regulatory floor, it can be left empty.

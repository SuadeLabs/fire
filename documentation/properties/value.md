# value

---

The **value** property gives the monetary value of the collateral *as determined by the institution*. It should be noted that this is not the market value or of the collateral.

While in some cases the market value will be equivalent to the **value**, for less liquid assets, such as property, the **value** will be the primary number used for calculation of risk ratios such as loan-to-value.

For reverse mortgages, **value** is the appraised value, used to derive LTV.  Reference OSFI Chapter 4, P115.  

For mortgages, **value** used to derive current LTV.  Reference OSFI Chapter 4, P91-92.

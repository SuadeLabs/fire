# source

---

Similar to the [**product_name**][product_name] property, the **source** property is designed to aid the institution with principles of data control and governance as outlined by the [Basel Committee on Banking Supervision][bcbs239]. It is a strong value for the firm to indicate the source system for the data attribute.

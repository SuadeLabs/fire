> Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 (DR with regard to liquidity coverage requirement) does not provide for any grace periods meaning that all payments that are delayed, even if just for only one single day and even if only for technical reasons, have to be considered as being past due for the purposes of the LCR calculation of liquidity inflows.

![FINREP](https://www.eba.europa.eu/single-rule-book-qa/-/qna/view/publicId/2013_194)

> Assets qualify as past due when counterparties have failed to make a payment when contractually due according to Annex V.

The whole amounts of such assets shall be reported and broken down according to the number of days of the oldest past due instalment.

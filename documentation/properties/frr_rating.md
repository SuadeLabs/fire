Risk metric used to assess the risk associated with a particular financial facility or product, such as a loan, derivative, or credit line. 

It evaluates the inherent risk based on factors like market conditions, counterparty risk, the structure of the facility, and the collateral or guarantees involved.

The BIRR rating provides an internal measure of risk and is typically used for assessing borrowers in lending or investment decisions.

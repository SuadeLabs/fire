# contribution_text

---

The **contribution_text** is used where contributions are not monetary values, but rather text/string values or decimals/percentages. As these values are typically used in reporting in a one-to-one correspondence, aggregations of contribution texts typically don't make sense. Implementation specific cases may also be present to account for the wider range of non-monetary reportable values.

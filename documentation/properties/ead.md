# ead

---

Exposure at default (EAD) is used in estimating Loss Given Default (LGD). When measuring EAD, institutions should reflect the expected exposure amount at the time of default, taking into account any undrawn commitments, accrued interest, fees, and other off-balance sheet items that may become due in the event of default. Reported on a Post-CRM basis.

Inclusions are drawn balances, accrued interest, fees, and any undrawn amounts that may be utilised prior to or at the point of default, net of credit risk mitigation where applicable.

Institutions are to apply the definition and calculation of Exposure at Default consistently according to their internal approach. Internal calculation is specific to each FI and should reflect the total exposure expected to be outstanding at the moment of default for the reporting quarter.

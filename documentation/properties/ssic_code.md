The Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) is the national standard for classifying economic activities undertaken by economic units and is used for censuses of population, household and establishment surveys and, increasingly, in administrative databases. The SSIC adopts the basic framework and principles of the [International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities][isic-wiki] (ISIC).  It is reviewed and updated regularly to reflect significant changes in the structure of the Singapore economy and the emergence of new activities as well as to align with changes in the international standard.

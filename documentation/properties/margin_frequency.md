# margin_frequency

In a credit support annex, the **margin_frequency** is the periodic timescale at which variation margin is exchanged. 
    
Cleared derivatives which are settled daily can be flagged as **daily_settled**.

## Magin frequency in regulation

In the [Margin Requirements for non-cleared derivatives][bcbs_317], a *sufficient* frequency for exchanging variation margin is defined as **daily**.
In the [CRR][CRR], the **margin_frequency** is used in Article 285 in order to derive the margin period of risk.

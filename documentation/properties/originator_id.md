# originator_id

---


The unique identifier used by the financial institution to identify the originator of the loan or security.

For loans, an originator typically refers to mortgages originated elsewhere from the firm and later purchased by the firm.
In the context of a security, this is commonly used in reference to the originator of a securitisation.

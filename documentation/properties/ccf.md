The **credit conversion factor** estimates the exposure at default of off-balance sheet items. The credit conversion factors are regulator defined and are the estimated size and likely occurrence of the credit exposure, as well as the relative degree of credit risk.

See [here][EBA] for the clasification of off-balance sheet adjustments and [here][EBA2] for the exposure values for different risk categories.

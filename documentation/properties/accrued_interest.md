# accrued_interest

**accrued\_interest** represents the interest accumulated *but unpaid* since the [last\_payment\_date][lpd] and due at the [next\_payment\_date][npd].

Accrued interest is an accounting definition resulting from the [accrual basis][acc] of accounting. Generally speaking, this should be the amount reported on the income statement and the balance sheet (as not yet been paid/received). In other words, it is income earned or expenses incurred but not yet recognised in the revenues.

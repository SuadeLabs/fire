# eif_thirdparty_rw_ind

---

The **eif_thirdparty_rw_ind** property is a boolean (true/false) to idenfiy when "Institutions may rely on third-party calculations for determining the risk weights associated with their equity investments in funds (i.e., the underlying risk weights of the exposures of the fund) if they do not have adequate data or information to perform the calculations themselves. In such cases, the applicable risk weight shall be 1.2 times higher than the one that would be applicable if the exposure were held directly by the institutionFootnote56.[Basel Framework, CRE 60.5]."  REF: OSFI Chapter 4, P150.

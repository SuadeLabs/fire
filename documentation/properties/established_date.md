# established_date

---

The **established_date** reflects the date from which the investee’s business age is determined. This may differ from the legal incorporation date.

For PRA-regulated entities, this field supports compliance with Article 133 of the CRR as implemented under Basel 3.1, including the assessment of how long a business has existed for equity exposure risk-weight determination.

In accordance with the PRA definition, **established_date** is the date from which the business age begins to be calculated, and should reflect:
1. where the business was first established within the current undertaking, the date the business was first established within that undertaking; or
2. where the business was established within a different undertaking and subsequently transferred:
        - the original establishment date if the risk profile and nature of the business did not substantially change as a result of the transfer; or
        - the date of transfer if the risk profile or nature of the business substantially changed as a result of the transfer.

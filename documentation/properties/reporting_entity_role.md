# reporting_entity_role

The **reporting_entity_role** attribute identifies the role an entity plays in a securitisation transaction. It helps users understand whether an entity is providing the assets, structuring the vehicle, or investing in the issued securities.

### investor
An entity that holds a position in (i.e., has purchased securities issued by) the securitisation transaction.

### originator
The entity that either (a) created the original lending agreements giving rise to the exposures being securitised, or (b) purchased exposures from a third party for its own account and then securitises them.


### sponsor
A credit institution or investment firm (other than an originator) that establishes and manages a securitisation programme (such as ABCP) that purchases exposures from third-party entities. The sponsor may delegate day-to-day portfolio management to an authorised entity.

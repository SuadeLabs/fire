The **credit_impaired** identifier is a boolean to flag if the customer credit quality is impaired.

**According to the [FCA Handbook][fca], a credit-impaired customer is a customer who:**

* (a) within the last two years has owed overdue payments, in an amount equivalent to three months' payments, on a mortgage or other loan (whether secured or unsecured), except where the amount overdue reached that level because of late payment caused by errors by a bank or other third party; or
* (b) has been the subject of one or more county court judgments, with a total value greater than Â£500, within the last three years; or
* (c) has been subject to an individual voluntary arrangement or bankruptcy order which was in force at any time within the last three years.

**Further, according to the [European Commission Liquidity Coverage Requirement Delegated Act][ec]:**

The definition of credit-impaired obligors or guarantors is both backward-looking (e.g. the obligor has declared bankruptcy, or has recently agreed with his creditors to a debt dismissal or reschedule, or is on an official registry of persons with adverse credit history) and forward-looking (e.g. the obligor has a credit assessment by an external credit assessment institution or has a credit score indicating a significant risk that contractually agreed payments will not be made compared to the average obligor for this type of loans in the relevant jurisdiction).

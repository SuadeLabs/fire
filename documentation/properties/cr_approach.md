Securitisation Standardised Approach - Look-through Approach
For securitisation calculations, when the financial institution has full knowledge of the composition of the underlying exposures of pool at all time, the institution can apply the "look-through" approach to senior securitization exposures.  
See [OSFI Chapter 7, P134 or Basel Framework, CRE 40.50](https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/CAR22_chpt6.aspx#ToC6.6.5)

## eif_lt
Equity Investments in Funds - Look-through Approach
The LTA requires a bank to risk weight the underlying exposures of a fund as if the exposures were held directly by the bank. This is the most granular and risk-sensitive approach. It must be used when:
(1) there is sufficient and frequent information provided to the bank regarding the underlying exposures of the fund; and
(2) such information is verified by an independent third party.
See [Basel CRE60 Equity Investments in Funds, CRE 60.2](https://www.bis.org/basel_framework/chapter/CRE/60.htm)

### eif_mba
Equity Investments in Funds - Mandate-based Approach
The second approach, the MBA, provides a method for calculating regulatory capital that can be used when the conditions for applying the LTA are not met.
Under the MBA banks may use the information contained in a fund's mandate or in the national regulations governing such investment funds.
See [Basel CRE60 Equity Investments in Funds, CRE 60.6](https://www.bis.org/basel_framework/chapter/CRE/60.htm)

### eif_fb
Equity Investmnets in Funds - Fall-back Approach
Where neither the LTA nor the MBA is feasible, banks are required to apply the FBA. The FBA applies a 1250% risk weight to the bankâ€™s equity investment in the fund.

For securitisation standardized approach (sec-sa), **k_sa** is the hypothetical capital charge under the Standardised Approach that the underlying exposures would have had, had they not been securitised. **k_sa** is used as input for the calculation of Ka in sec-sa methodology.  Input required to calculate ksa if underlying pool data is not provided.

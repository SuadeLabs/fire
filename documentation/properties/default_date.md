The **default_date** is the date on which the obligor first meets the institutionâ€™s default criteria, such as being past due more than 90 days or deemed unlikely to pay. This date marks the start of the default event for regulatory and internal purposes. It is in date-time format in accordance with the ISO 8601 standard (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).

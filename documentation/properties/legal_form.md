# legal_form

The **legal form** is a code that represents the type of business entity as defined in the EU national legal system

The type of business entity as defined in the national legal system is reported in this data attribute. Depending on the country of residency of the counterparty, the list of admissible options is presented in the “list of legal forms” (the list of legal forms can
be found on the ECB’s website).

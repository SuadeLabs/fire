# description

A free text field that provides additional descriptive information about the product. This field can be used to capture any relevant details that don't fit into other structured fields.

For example, a description of a security that gives a more user-friendly name of the security or issuer, type or nature of obligation, and, if applicable, key terms such as the maturity date and stated interest rate.

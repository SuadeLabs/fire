# arrears_arrangement

---

The **arrears_arrangement** is the property of a loan that describes how the borrower and lender are dealing with the unpaid capital or interest payments indicated in the **arrears_balance**. The options include:

### temporary
This indicates cases where the lender has made a temporary concession to the borrower to assist them with their payments of the **arrears_balance**. 
From [MLAR][mlar]:
> agreement with the borrower whereby monthly payments are either suspended or less than they would be on a fully commercial basis

### formal
This indicates that a formal arrangement has been agreed with the borrower to capitalise the loan with the view to decrease the **arrears_balance** with future payments.

### none
No temporary or formal arrangement or contact has been made with the borrower to "solve" the balance outstanding in the **arrears_balance**.

### possessed
Cases where the underlying collateral has been seized or taken into possession by the lender.

From [MLAR][mlar]:
> In possession: cases should be included here where the property is
F3.6/F4.6 taken in possession (through any method e.g. voluntary surrender, court
order etc). For development loans in particular, cases should also be
included where the appointment of a receiver and/or a manager has been
made, or where the security is being enforced in other ways (which may
or may not also involve the existence of arrears e.g. building finance case
with interest roll up, no arrears, but a current valuation is less than the
outstanding debt).

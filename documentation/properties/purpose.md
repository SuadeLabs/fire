### deposit
The **deposit** enum value refers to a retail deposit defined in accordance with Article 411 of the [CRR][crr]:

> A liability to a natural person or to an SME, where the natural person or the SME would qualify for the retail exposure class under the Standardised or IRB approaches for credit risk, or a liability to a company which is eligible for the treatment set out in Article 153(4) and where the aggregate deposits by all such enterprises on a group basis do not exceed EUR 1 million.

### ci_service
The **ci_service** enum value refers to accounts covered by central institution services or held within a cooperative network.

Opening paragraph 12 of the [LCR][lcr] states that liquidity calculations should take into account:
> centralised management of liquidity in cooperative and institutional protection scheme networks where the central institution or body plays a role akin to a central bank because the members of the network do not typically have direct access to the latter.
> Appropriate rules should, therefore, recognise as liquid assets the sight deposits which are made by the members of the network with the central institution and other liquidity funding available to those from the central institution.

Assets placed as a **ci_service** should be considered unencumbered inaccordance with Artcle 7.2(a) of the [LCR][lcr]:
> assets included in a pool which are available for immediate use as collateral to obtain additional funding under committed but not yet funded credit lines available to the credit institution. This shall include assets placed by a credit institution with the central institution in a cooperative network or institutional protection scheme.

### collateral
The **collateral** enum type identifies an account or deposit received as collateral and hence, not classified as a liability for the purposes of Article 27 and 29 of the [LCR][lcr]. Collateral held in an account should have a corresponding [**id**][id] in the collateral schema

### ips
Within the context of **operational** deposits as defined in Artcle 27.1(d) of the [LCR][lcr], the **ips** enum indicates that the account is maintained by the depositor to obtain cash clearing and central institution services and where the deposit taking institution belongs to an  institutional protection scheme or equivalent network as referred in Article 16 of the [LCR][lcr].

### escrow
*needs definition*

### operational_escrow
*needs definition*

### clearing
The **clearing** enum value indicates that the account or deposit is being maintained for clearing, settlement, custody or cash management services in the context of an **operational** relationship and hence can be treated as a very short term exposure.

Clearing and comparable services from the [CRR][crr] Article 422.4:
> Clearing, custody or cash management or other comparable services referred to in points (a) and (d) of paragraph 3 only covers such services to the extent that they are rendered in the context of an established relationship on which the depositor has substantial dependency. They shall not merely consist in correspondent banking or prime brokerage services and the institution shall have evidence that the client is unable to withdraw amounts legally due over a 30 day horizon without compromising its operational functioning.

### operational
Operational deposit from the [LCR][lcr] Article 27.6:
> 6. In order to identify the deposits referred to in point (c) of paragraph 1, a credit institution shall consider that there is an established operational relationship with a non-financial customer, excluding term deposits, savings deposits and brokered deposits, where all of the following criteria are met:
> (a) the remuneration of the account is priced at least 5 basis points below the prevailing rate for wholesale deposits with comparable characteristics, but need not be negative;
> (b) the deposit is held in specifically designated accounts and priced without creating economic incentives for the depositor to maintain funds in the deposit in excess of what is needed for the operational relationship;
> (c) material transactions are credited and debited on a frequent basis on the account considered;
> (d) one of the following criteria is met:
> (i) the relationship with the depositor has existed for at least 24 months;
> (ii) the deposit is used for a minimum of 2 active services. These services may include direct or indirect access to national or international payment services, security trading or depository services.
> Only that part of the deposit which is necessary to make use of the service of which the deposit is a by-product shall be treated as an operational deposit. The excess shall be treated as non-operational.

### operational_excess
Excess operational deposits are defined as the part of the operational deposits (as defined in [LCR][lcr] Article 27.6) held in excess of those required for the provision of operational services. The distinction between operational deposits and excess operational deposits is required for the reporting of section 1.1.3 in the ouflows section of the [LCR][lcr]

### custody
As opposed to short-term definition within **operational**, **custody** here refers to the long-term custody of financial assets such as those held for safekeeping by a custodian bank.

### prime_brokerage
Describes an account held for prime brokerage reasons but not including those contained above for operational reasons. These accounts are used for prime brokerage service transactions which are in essence investment activities including securities lending, leveraged trade executions and cash management, among other things.

### investment property
IAS 40.5 defines **investment property** as:
> property (land or a building - or part of a building - or both) held (by the owner or by the lessee as a right-of-use asset) to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for:
(a) use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes; or
(b) sale in the ordinary course of business.

### own_property
IAS 40.5 defines **owner occupied property** as:
> property held (by the owner or by the lessee as a right-of-use asset) for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.

For example, for the reporting of Notice MAS 610/1003, **owner occupied property** includes bank premises.

### property

### revenue_reserve
A type of reserve account. This is created when an entity retains an amount of its distributable profit.

### share_plan
This is a reserve account where funds are held with the purpose of share plans and other equity based compensation.

### reg_loss
This is a reserve that is created when an entity allocates funds to a reserve account for the purpose of complying with requirements for minimum **regulatory loss allowances**.

For example, [MAS Notice 612][MAS612] (section 6.3.7) requires locally incorporated domestic systemically important banks to maintain a minimum level of loss allowance equivalent to 1% of the gross carrying amount of selected credit exposures net of collateral. This is referred to as the Minimum Regulatory Loss Allowance. Where the entity's Accounting Loss Allowance (calculated in accordance with the impairment requirements under FRS 109) falls below the Minimum Regulatory Loss Allowance, the entity shall maintain the difference in a non-distributable regulatory loss allowance reserve which shall be appropriated from retained earnings.

[MAS612]: https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/notices/notice-612

### cf_hedge
IFRS 9.6.5.2 defines a **cash flow hedge** as follows:
 > a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with all, or a component of, a  recognised asset or liability (such as all or some future interest payments on variable-rate debt) or a highly probable forecast transaction, and could affect profit or loss.

IFRS 9 refers to the **cash flow hedge reserve** as the separate equity component associated with the hedged item. In hedge accounting under IFRS, this account is a key component of the recognition of a hedging relationship.

For example, in the EBA's FINREP F.1.3 report, the effective portion of the variation in fair value of hedging derivatives in a cash flow hedge, both for ongoing cash flow hedges and cash flow hedges that no longer apply, is reported as the **cash flow hedge reserve**.

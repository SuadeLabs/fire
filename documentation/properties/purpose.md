The **purpose** property describes the reason behind the creation or usage of the financial product *as seen from the point of view of the financial institution*.

## Account

### deposit
The **deposit** enum value refers to a retail deposit defined in accordance with Article 411 of the [CRR][crr]:

> A liability to a natural person or to an SME, where the natural person or the SME would qualify for the retail exposure class under the Standardised or IRB approaches for credit risk, or a liability to a company which is eligible for the treatment set out in Article 153(4) and where the aggregate deposits by all such enterprises on a group basis do not exceed EUR 1 million.

### ci_service
The **ci_service** enum value refers to accounts covered by central institution services or held within a cooperative network.

Opening paragraph 12 of the [LCR][lcr] states that liquidity calculations should take into account:
> centralised management of liquidity in cooperative and institutional protection scheme networks where the central institution or body plays a role akin to a central bank because the members of the network do not typically have direct access to the latter.
> Appropriate rules should, therefore, recognise as liquid assets the sight deposits which are made by the members of the network with the central institution and other liquidity funding available to those from the central institution.

Assets placed as a **ci_service** should be considered unencumbered inaccordance with Artcle 7.2(a) of the [LCR][lcr]:
> assets included in a pool which are available for immediate use as collateral to obtain additional funding under committed but not yet funded credit lines available to the credit institution. This shall include assets placed by a credit institution with the central institution in a cooperative network or institutional protection scheme.

### collateral
The **collateral** enum type identifies an account or deposit received as collateral and hence, not classified as a liability for the purposes of Article 27 and 29 of the [LCR][lcr]. Collateral held in an account should have a corresponding [**id**][id] in the collateral schema.

### operational
The **clearing** enum value indicates that the account or deposit is being maintained for clearing, settlement, custody or cash management services in the context of an **operational** relationship and hence can be treated as a very short term exposure. 

Clearing and comparable services from the [CRR][crr] Article 422.4:
> Clearing, custody or cash management or other comparable services referred to in points (a) and (d) of paragraph 3 only covers such services to the extent that they are rendered in the context of an established relationship on which the depositor has substantial dependency. They shall not merely consist in correspondent banking or prime brokerage services and the institution shall have evidence that the client is unable to withdraw amounts legally due over a 30 day horizon without compromising its operational functioning.

Operational deposit from the [CRR][crr] Article 27.6:
> 6. In order to identify the deposits referred to in point (c) of paragraph 1, a credit institution shall consider that there is an established operational relationship with a non-financial customer, excluding term deposits, savings deposits and brokered deposits, where all of the following criteria are met:
> (a) the remuneration of the account is priced at least 5 basis points below the prevailing rate for wholesale deposits with comparable characteristics, but need not be negative;
> (b) the deposit is held in specifically designated accounts and priced without creating economic incentives for the depositor to maintain funds in the deposit in excess of what is needed for the operational relationship;
> (c) material transactions are credited and debited on a frequent basis on the account considered;
> (d) one of the following criteria is met:
> (i) the relationship with the depositor has existed for at least 24 months;
> (ii) the deposit is used for a minimum of 2 active services. These services may include direct or indirect access to national or international payment services, security trading or depository services.
> Only that part of the deposit which is necessary to make use of the service of which the deposit is a by-product shall be treated as an operational deposit. The excess shall be treated as non-operational.

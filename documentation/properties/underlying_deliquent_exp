The **underlying_deliquent_exp**  is the total underlying delinquent exposure in the pool, that is 90 days or more past due or in default.  Provided when underlying exposures are not known or attached to pool for securitisation calculations of w_ratio under sec_sa calculation approach.  Not required if underlying pool exposures are attached to the asset securitisation instrument and in order to determine the total exposure of defaulted exposures.

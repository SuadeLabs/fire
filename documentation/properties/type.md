# customer, issuer, guarantor, entity
Customer, issuer, guarantor and entity schemas share a lot of common type attributes so they are grouped together here. Also, due to the complexity of this property, the variety of reporting granularity and the larger issue of data quality at firms, the fields are not all mutually exclusive and should be thought of more as a tree rather than unique items:

### individual
Individual is a UK specific definition which is slightly broader than a natural person and defined in the [FCA Handbook Glossary][fca-indiv] under individual:
> (a) a natural person; or
> (b) a partnership consisting of two or three persons not all of whom are bodies corporate; or
> (c) an unincorporated body of persons which does not consist entirely of bodies corporate and is not a partnership.

### natural_person
Natural person refers to a human being, as you would expect. It is further defined in the [Data Protection Directive][dpd]:

### sme

Company category | Staff headcount | Turnover (or) | Balance sheet total
-----------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------------
Medium-sized     | < 250           | ≤ € 50 m      | ≤ € 43 m            
Small            | < 50            | ≤ € 10 m      | ≤ € 10 m

### bond
A **bond** is a type of loan whereby an investor lends money to an entity for a defined period of time at a fixed or floating interest rate.

### covered_bond
From the [LCR][lcr] Introduction (8):
> Covered bonds are debt instruments issued by credit institutions and secured by a cover pool of assets which typically consist of mortgage loans or public sector debt to which investors have a preferential claim in the event of default. Their secured nature and certain additional safety features, such as the requirement on the issuer to replace non-performing assets in the cover pool and maintain the cover pool at a value exceeding the par value of the bonds (‘asset coverage requirement’), have contributed to make covered bonds relatively low-risk, yield-bearing instruments with a key funding role in mortgage markets of most Member States. In certain Member States outstanding covered bond issuance exceeds the pool of outstanding government bonds. Certain covered bonds of credit quality step 1, in particular, exhibited an excellent liquidity performance during the period from 1 January 2008 to 30 June 2012 analysed by the EBA in its report. Nevertheless the EBA recommended treating these covered bonds as level 2A assets to align with BCBS standards. However, in the light of the considerations made above about their credit quality, liquidity performance and role in the funding markets of the Union, it is appropriate for these credit quality step 1 covered bonds to be treated as level 1 assets. In order to avoid excessive concentration risks and unlike other level 1 assets, the holdings of credit quality step 1 covered bonds in the liquidity buffer should be subject to a 70 % cap of the overall buffer, a minimum 7 % haircut and to the diversification requirement.

### convertible_bond
Generally, a **convertible_bond** is a security which gives the investor the right to convert the security into shares at an agreed price on an agreed basis.

### abs
An asset-backed security is a security whose income payments and hence value are derived from and collateralised (or "backed") by a specified pool of underlying assets. The pool of assets is typically a group of small and illiquid assets which are unable to be sold individually. Pooling the assets into financial instruments allows them to be sold to general investors, a process called securitisation. This allows the risk of investing in the underlying assets to be diversified because each security will represent a fraction of the total value of the diverse pool of underlying assets. The pools of underlying assets can include common payments from credit cards, auto loans, and mortgage loans, to esoteric cash flows from aircraft leases, royalty payments and movie revenues.

### rmbs
A residential mortgage-backed security (a subclass of an ABS).

### rmbs_trans

> 2.   By derogation from Article 13, securitisations issued after 1 October 2015, where the underlying exposures are residential loans as referred to in point (g)(i) of Article 13(2) that do not meet the average loan-to-value or the loan-to-income requirements set out in that point, shall qualify as Level 2B assets until 1 October 2025, provided that the underlying exposures include residential loans that were not subject to a national law regulating loan-to-income limits at the time they were granted and such residential loans were granted at any time prior to 1 October 2015.

The value bands and ratios were specified by HM Treasury in the Cash Ratio Deposits (Value Bands and Ratios) Order (2013 No 1189).

### guarantee
From EU [Supervisory Reporting][sup-rep] part 2(9):
> 'Financial guarantees' are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder of a loss it incurs, because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. Under IFRS or compatible National GAAP, these contracts meet the IAS 39.9 and IFRS 4.A definition of financial guarantee contracts. The following items of Annex I of the CRR shall be classified as 'financial guarantees':
> (a) Guarantees having the character of credit substitute.
> (b) Credit derivatives that meet the definition of financial guarantee.
> (c) Irrevocable standby letters of credit having the character of credit substitutes.

### trade_credit_insurance
From the [EBA's][eba-nsfr-report] report on the NSFR, section 6.2.1 outlines what **trade credit insurance** is:
> A seller providing trade credit is exposed to the credit risk of the buyer. Trade credit insurance provides the seller with protection against the risk of non-payment by the buyer. The nonpayment may be due to the insolvency of the buyer or, in an international trade, due to political risks that prevent payment.

### letter_of_credit
From the [EBA's][eba-nsfr-report] report on the NSFR, section 6.2.2, a **letter of credit** is:
> When goods are traded, the seller and the buyer need to agree on the process of how to pay for the goods. While the buyer may be reluctant to prepay for the traded goods, the seller may also be unwilling to ship the goods before payment is made. In this situation, a bank can intermediate between the trading partners by providing an import letter of credit (L/C) to the buyer of the goods, which guarantees payment to the seller.
> A L/C is a contingent liability and payment is only made by the bank to the seller from funds in the buyer’s account when the documentation of shipping is presented.

### project_finance
As defined in [Supervisory Reporting][sup-rep] part 2(5)(41)(l):
> 'Project finance loans' include loans that are recovered solely from the income of the projects financed by them.

### acceptance
From EU [Supervisory Reporting][sup-rep] part 2(5)(60)(b):
> “Acceptances” are obligations by an institution to pay on maturity the face value of a bill of exchange, normally covering the sale of goods. Consequently, they are classified as “trade receivables” on the balance sheet

### financial_guarantee
From EU [Supervisory Reporting][sup-rep] part 2(9):
> 'Financial guarantees' are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder of a loss it incurs, because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. Under IFRS or compatible National GAAP, these contracts meet the IAS 39.9 and IFRS 4.A definition of financial guarantee contracts.

### call
A call account is defined in the [Money Market Statistics Regulation][mm-stat] in Annex II as:
> A debt instrument in which the issuer has a call option, i.e. an option to redeem the instrument early, with a final repayment date of not more than one year from the date of issuance.

### cd
A deposit account purely holding certificates of deposit (see *cd* *Security* **type**)

### prepaid_card
From the [Interchange Fees for Card-based Payments Regulation][card-fees] Article 2(35):
> prepaid card means a category of payment instrument on which electronic money, as defined in point 2 of Article 2 of Directive 2009/110/EC, is stored.
NB. see **credit_card**

### debit_card
From the [Interchange Fees for Card-based Payments Regulation][card-fees] Article 2(33) and (4):
> debit card means a category of payment instrument that enables the payer to initiate a debit card transaction excluding those with prepaid cards;
> debit card transaction means a card-based payment transaction, including those with prepaid cards that is not a credit card transaction;

NB. see **credit_card**

### credit_card
A credit card is typically an off-balance sheet, contingent funding obligation whereby a customer has a certian credit limit and may borrow funds at any point, up to that limit, similar to a card-based credit facility.

The [Interchange Fees for Card-based Payments Regulation][card-fees] states that:
> There are two main types of credit cards available on the market. With deferred debit cards, the total amount of transactions is debited from the cardholder account at a pre-agreed specific date, usually once a month, without interest to be paid. With other credit cards, the cardholder can use a credit facility in order to reimburse part of the amounts due at a later date than specified, together with interest or other costs.

A credit card is then defined in Article 2 (34) and (5) as:
> credit card means a category of payment instrument that enables the payer to initiate a credit card transaction;
> credit card transaction means a card-based payment transaction where the amount of the transaction is debited in full or in part at a pre agreed specific calendar month date to the payer, in line with a prearranged credit facility, with or without interest;

### current (checking, demand)
Any transactional account.

### bonds
Any account containing notes, bonds or other securities instruments.

### retail_bonds
As referenced in the [LCR][lcr] Regulation Article 28 (6) as any account:
> containing notes, bonds and other securities issued which are sold exclusively in the retail market and held in a retail account. Limitations shall be placed such that those instruments cannot be bought and held by parties other than retail customers.


### internet_only
An internet-only account is one that is offered and only accessible via the internet. The [FCA][fca-internet] defines the internet in their handbook as:
> a unique medium for communicating financial promotions as it provides easy access to a very wide audience. At the same time, it provides very little control over who is able to access the financial promotion.

The distinction here linked to financial promotions suggests that internet-only accounts are sold and managed through a higher risk channel and therefore should be regulated spearately to other accounts.

### isa
An ISA is an individual savings account which is a scheme of investment satisfying the conditions prescribed in the UK's [ISA Regulations][uk-isa].

### money_market
A money market account is an interest-bearing account that typically pays a higher interest rate than a savings account, and which provides the account holder with limited check-writing ability.

Money market accounts are accounts where the customer's money has been invested in the "money markets" either directly in money market instruments or money market funds which are described in the [2013 Proposal for the Regulation of Money Market Funds][mmf-prpposal] as providing a key component of corporate banking:
> On the demand side, MMFs offer a short-term cash management tool that provides a high degree of liquidity, diversification, stability of value combined with a market-based yield. MMFs are mainly used by corporations seeking to invest their excess cash for a short time frame, for example until a major expenditure, such as the payroll, is due.

Money market deposits are mentioned in association with definitions of cash in that they represent *claims for the repayment of money*.

### vostro (loro)
Nostro and vostro (loro) accounts are used in the context of correspondent banking operations which are described in [ECB guidelines on monetary policy instruments][ecb-guidelines] from 2003:
> Correspondent banking: an arrangement under which one credit institution provides payment and other services to another credit institution. Payments through correspondents are often executed through reciprocal accounts (nostro and loro accounts) to which standing credit lines may be attached. Correspondent banking services are primarily provided across international boundaries but are also known as agency relationships in some domestic contexts.
> A loro account is the term used by a correspondent to describe an account held on behalf of a foreign credit institution; the foreign credit institution would in turn regard this account as its nostro account.

### savings
An account subject to the European Council [Directive on taxation of savings][eur-savings-tax]. A savings account essentially does not allow the customer to use funds in the account as a "medium of exchange" such as writing checks or for making ATM withdrawals. Hence, funds are typically not callable immediately and/or incur a withdrawal penalty such as loss of interest.
In the US, [Regulation D][reg-d] uses the characteristics of the 'reservation of right' and 'convenient' withdrawals to describe savings accounts:
> In order to classify an account as a 'savings deposit,' the institution must in its account agreement with the customer reserve the right at any time to require seven days’ advance written notice of an intended withdrawal. In practice, this right is never exercised, but the institution must nevertheless reserve that right in the account agreement. In addition, for an account to be
classified as a 'savings deposit,' the depositor may make no more than six 'convenient' transfers or withdrawals per month from the account.

### time_deposit
A fixed-term deposit with a specific [**end_date**][end-date].
The [US Regulation D][reg-d] describes time deposits as having the following characteristics:
> Time deposit accounts have the following characteristics:
> - must have a maturity of at least seven days from
the date of deposit
> - may require at least seven days’ prior written
notice of intent to withdraw funds
> - must be subject to early withdrawal penalties if
funds are withdrawn within six days of the date of
deposit or within six days of the date of the
immediately preceding partial withdrawal
> - may be interest-bearing
> - may be evidenced by a negotiable or nonnegotiable,
transferable or nontransferable certificate,
instrument, passbook, book entry, or
other similar instrument
> - include club accounts (such as Christmas club or
vacation club accounts)
> - no eligibility requirements

### deposit
Deposit or depository account is defined in the [Directive regarding the mandatory exchange of tax information][exch-tax-info] section 8:
> The term “Depository Account” includes any commercial, checking, savings, time, or thrift account, or an account that is evidenced by a certificgitcheckoutate of deposit, thrift certificate, investment certificate, certificate of indebtedness, or other similar instrument maintained by a Financial Institution in the ordinary course of a banking or similar business. A Depository Account also includes an amount held by an insurance company pursuant to a guaranteed investment contract or similar agreement to pay or credit interest thereon.

### non_product
This is an overarching term used to define any non-product accounts that may exist on the balance sheet, ledger or other income/P&L accounts.

### amortisation
An account which holds the **amortisation amount** of intangible assets measured at cost model. IAS 38.74 defines cost model measurement of intangible assets as follow:
> After initial recognition intangible assets should be carried at cost less accumulated **amortisation** and impairment losses

### deferred
A **deferred** account is an account in which the recognition of certain revenue or expenses on the income statement is delayed for a certain period of time. For example, a deferred tax asset, which is reported in F1.01 of FINREP,  is defined by IAS 12.5 as follows:
> the amounts of income taxes recoverable in future periods in respect of:
(a) deductible temporary differences;
(b) the carryforward of unused tax losses; and
(c) the carryforward of unused tax credits.

### non_deferred
Undeferred is used to avoid confusion with a customer current account. This is in reference to a current asset or current liability eg. (current tax liability) where it is recognised typically within the next 12 months.

### intangible
An account which holds intangible assets. IAS 38 defines an **intangible asset** as:
> an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance.

### tangible
An account that holds tangible assets. From the definition of an **intangible asset**, we can infer that tangible assets refers to an asset has physical substance, for example, property or machinery.

### suspense
Transactions will be considered to be in [**suspense**][suspense] if there is some doubt at the time of reporting regarding how the transaction  should be classified and reported, for example, which ledger should it be posted to.

MAS Notice 610 and Notice 1003 refers to **suspense** accounts as all outstanding unreconciled amounts that are kept in suspense.

[suspense]: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/suspenseaccount.asp

### provision
IAS 37.10 defines a **provision** as:
> a liability of uncertain timing or amount

### income
An account representing monies received (over a period).

### expense
An account representing monies spent (over a period).

### reserve
An account holding reserves. [Reserves][reserve] are created from profit or from capital gains and are retained by an entity for a specific or more general purpose. Reserves are essentially anything on the equity side of the balance sheet that is not capital.

[reserve]:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_(accounting)

# collateral
The collateral type defines the form of the collateral, such as property or other assets used to secure an obligation.

The [EC Collateral Directive][arrangement] states:
> The assets can be provided: either by transfer of full ownership from a collateral provider to a collateral taker; or by the transfer of possession from a collateral provider to a collateral taker under a security right (e.g. pledge, charge or lien), where the full ownership of the assets remains with the collateral provider.

# total_resi_mortgages

---

Total number of qualifying mortgaged residential properties held by the obligor across all lenders, excluding the primary residence.

Used to support the assessment under the PRA Rulebook, Appendix 2, Article 124E, to determine whether a real estate exposure is materially dependent on the cash flows generated by the property.

Article 124E defines a qualifying property as:

### For a Natural Person
A qualifying property is a property that is residential real estate, is not the primary residence of the natural person and that is either: 
(a) security for a residential real estate exposure to the natural person, regardless of which lender has the residential real estate exposure; or 
(b) security for a residential real estate exposure to an entity which is created specifically to finance and/or operate immovable property, where the natural person acts as a guarantor to the exposure and receives the economic benefit from the residential real estate, regardless of which lender has the residential real estate exposure. 

### For an Entity
A qualifying property is a property that is residential real estate, is not the primary residence of the guarantor, and is security for a residential real estate exposure to the entity, regardless of which lender has the real estate exposure.

The amount of money a borrower will contribute toward housing expenses (mortgage payment, real estate taxes, homeowner's insurance, association dues, etc.) after modification. A loan arrears arrangement or modification refers to a situation where a lender and borrower agree to adjust the terms of an existing loan due to the borrower's difficulty in making scheduled repayments. This typically occurs after the borrower falls behind, enters arrears, or anticipates they soon will.

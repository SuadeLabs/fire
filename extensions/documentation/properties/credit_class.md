### alt_a
Alternative-A Mortgage - A mortgage loan that falls between prime and subprime in terms of credit quality. These loans typically have higher interest rates than prime loans but lower rates than subprime loans, and may have less documentation requirements than prime loans.

### goverment_owned
Government-Owned Loan - A mortgage loan that is owned or guaranteed by a government entity such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae, or other government-sponsored enterprises.

### non_prime
Non-Prime Mortgage - A mortgage loan that does not meet the criteria for prime loans, typically due to the borrower's credit history, income documentation, or other risk factors. These loans generally have higher interest rates to compensate for the increased risk.

### prime
Prime Mortgage - A mortgage loan that meets the highest credit quality standards, typically offered to borrowers with excellent credit scores, stable income, and substantial down payments. These loans usually have the most favorable interest rates and terms.

### combined
Combined Repayment - A hybrid repayment structure that combines different repayment methods. This could include a combination of interest-only and principal repayment periods, or other repayment structures that don't fit into the standard categories.

### interest_only
Interest Only - The borrower is only required to pay the interest portion of the loan for a specified period. During this period, no principal is being repaid, and the loan balance remains unchanged.

### option_arm
Option ARM - An option or payment-option ARM is an adjustable rate mortgage with several possible payment choices. 

### other
Other Repayment Type - A repayment structure that doesn't fit into the standard categories. This could include specialized or custom repayment arrangements that are unique to specific loan products or borrower circumstances.

### repayment
Full Repayment - The standard repayment structure where the borrower makes regular payments that include both principal and interest components. These payments are designed to fully amortize the loan over its term.

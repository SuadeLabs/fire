# Contribution Requirements
1. When adding an attribute to a schema the attribute should be well defined in terms of data type (i.e. integer, string, enum etc.) and the attribute should respect the [guiding principles][guiding-principles]. 

2. For every new attribute there should be a corresponding documentation file. 

3. There should always be a justification and description in the pull request. This should indicate why the attribute should be in the project and/or why this contribution is important. 

4. All files must be valid, i.e. schema files are valid JSON and documentation is in Markdown format.
